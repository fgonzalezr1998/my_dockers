# Minecraft Server (Fercraft)

Here you will find the source files needed to create a minecraft server inside a Docker container.

This Docker is not so practical because when you destroy the container, all the data will be removed but I think that it is didactic anyway.

You can build the container using the *build.sh* script and run it using the *run.sh* script.

in addition, make sure to edit the *server.properties* file as you want before to build the Docker container
